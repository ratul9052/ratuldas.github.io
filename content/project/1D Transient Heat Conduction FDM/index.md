This project simulates the 1D transient heat conduction in a rod using the explicit Finite Difference Method (FDM). The code is implemented in Python and visualizes the temperature distribution over space and time using three different plots- a 2D line plot, a heatmap, and a 3D surface plot. The user can choose an initial condition for the temperature distribution, and the boundary conditions are fixed at zero for both ends of the rod.
