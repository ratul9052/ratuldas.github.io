  #     Learned:
  #     - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
  #     - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
  #     - Understand Bitcoinâ€™s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoinâ€™s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

  #   date: '2023-01-21'
  #   awarder: datacamp
  #   icon: datacamp
  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
